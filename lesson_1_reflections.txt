How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Was a simple exercice. It's a good way to find differences between files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having a repository.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can determine what is the exactly moment to save a logical change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because there are files that depends on other files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can view changes in files between logical versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can find the exactly removed or added lines affect to a crash.
